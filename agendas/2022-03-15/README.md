## Agenda

* Create agenda for next stream
* Tentative next stream date/time

## Topics

### Potential Future Stream Ideas/Topics

* Write Twitch chatbot for the stream!
  * Start from scratch! Why not? Plenty of existing options for chat bots
  * Might be some cool features we could write into our own
* Write Twitch extension!
  * Most interested in potential for community/viewer stream interaction
  * Maybe integrate stream feedback directly into the stream
* Build a website
  * XHTML? Still a draft last time I checked - still think it's cool!
  * Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) - always cool!
  * Might need one for Twitch extension anyway
  * CSS - BOO
* Build a game
  * Implement existing card/board game
  * Write something new? Something driven by community interest?
  * Ideally something chat can interact with on the stream
  * Potential for cool asymmetric gameplay
* Docker / Kubernetes (containers in general)
  * Probably need this eventually, good to learn
  * Infrastructure as Code books - Chef
* Mandelbrot Renderer
  * I love the program Chaos when I was younger - would be fun to re-implement
  * Maybe other cool fractal implementations
* Stream Programming
  * If OBS scene formatting exports "nicely" maybe put mine in source control?
  * Just try random things in OBS and see what happens
  * Finish researching Real Time Streaming Protocol (use cellphone cam as OBS source)
* Continuous Improvement
  * Lean/Agile methodologies - Single Piece Flow
  * Scrum/Kanban board - Trello? Jira?? Write our own???
  * Potentially very meta
* Git
  * I love talking about Git - for hours on end
* Programming Languages (discussion or actual coding)
  * C# would be best for serious work - most knowledgeable here
  * I should really learn Python
  * F#/Scala - would love to learn more functional programming
  * Go/Rust?
  * History of progamming languages? Random trivia?
* Software Licensing
  * If we're going to share code on the Web, how do we want to share it?
* Decide on Key Performance Indicators for stream
  * How much should raw viewership drive improvement?
  * Poll viewers for feedback on stream - likes/dislikes on particular aspects
* Stream content ratios
  * There's too many ideas: no need to limit to just one type of content
  * What fraction of streams should be dev? games? cooking? chatting?
* Lack of music on stream (while chatting)?
  * Find some sort of free/compliant LoFi background music? seems popular these days
  * Probably needs off-stream research - ask other streamers!
* Scheduling
  * Tentatively Tuesday nights + Friday nights: no other IRL events happening
  * Try to avoid scheduling over other streams we like to watch
* Mental Health
  * Streaming to relieve stress
  * Chat with friends
  * Get all these ideas out of my head
  * Unit tests for life
  * Belief that sharing my goals with others will motivate me to accomplish them
  * Belief that talking to Internet friends is better than talking to a rubber duck
* Video games
  * They are fun, entertaining
  * Maybe special themed events (Talk like a pirate day?)
  * Sometimes can trick me into getting exercise
* Karaoke
  * Because the viewers demand it!
* IRL Activities
  * Gardening?
  * Sewing/Cosplay?
* Avoid Controversy!
* Be Excellent To Each Other ‚ù§

## Off-stream prep

* Make sure VS Code is installed with Python extension
* Install all updates
* Test debugging - use breakpoints and look at locals
* Set up OBS scene for VS Code
* Find Python IRC library (we're assuming one exists)
* Read docs https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication
* Get OAuth token prepared - read from file (don't dox myself)

## Next Stream

### Planned Date/Time

Friday Night: 2022-03-18T18:00:00-07:00

### Agenda

* Start writing a Twitch chatbot!
* Maybe just start by following the tutorial (node.js): https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc
* Another broader API doc here: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/guide
* If there is a Python IRC library we could accomplish multiple goals at once!
