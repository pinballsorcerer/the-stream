## Agenda

* Explore Streamer.bot

## Learnings

* Streamer.bot commands are not necessarily prefixed with '!'
* CPH is an instance of `Plugins.InlineInvokeProxy`
* Pay attention to where assemblies are being loaded from
* Don't assume an assembly only uses a single namespace

## TODO

* Don't copy all of Streamer.bot to my output directory
* Setup new GitHub repo for this project

## Next stream

* Decide how much to separate the program code from the Streamer.bot code
* Essentially: how abstract should the core logic be?
