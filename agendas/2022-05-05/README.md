## Agenda

* Remember where we left off
  * Do not use `py -3 main.py` to startup - just `./main.py`
* Finish GitHub Workflow to restore pip packages
* Start researching how to build wheels
  * Moderate success - wheel built and stored in GitHub
  * Installed wheel does not have irc package so script fails

## Stream note

* Additional Python resources from chat
  * www.udacity.com - Free Python courses
* Should we be streaming in "Software and Game Development"?
  * Instead of "Science and Technology"

## Future stream ideas

* Figure out how to include dependencies in wheel
* Install pytest and write unit tests?
* Put the bot secret somewhere "better"
* Deploy to Free Azure App Service
* Fix line endings
