## Agenda

* Experiment with partial classes for a bit

## Learnings

* After RTFM - right clicking in the list of "references" allows adding by file
  * Having the assembly in the streamer.bot directory appears to work best
  * Assembly does not seem to reload while streamer.bot is running
  * Assembly does seem to reload if the sub-action is unloaded first?
* There is an `args` dictionary that can be used to inspect the command source

## Next time

* Expand the state machine - allow additional user input
* Additional game rules
* More fun!
