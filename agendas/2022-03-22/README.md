## Agenda

* Continue Twitch chatbot in Python
* Actually commit some code today? :)

## Notes

* Learned that the IRC channel name is case sensitive!
  * Maybe doesn't matter for seeing past messages but does for realtime?

## Offline To-Do

* Figure out Python linting in VSCode (black/flake8)
* Update bot Twitch profile

## Next Stream (tenatively 03-24/03-25)

* More commands?
* Track users in chat?
* Mod/VIP detection?
* More regular expressions?
* Abstract command handling logic?
* Spread positivity in chat (randomly)
* Do something more interesting with the bot?
* Implement OAuth handshake to get new token on startup?
* To the cloud? To a container? Container in the cloud??
